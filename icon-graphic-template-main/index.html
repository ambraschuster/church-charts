			<p class="intro">After a year of renovation, not much of Park Church Co-Op, once a beloved community space in Greenpoint is left. In 2024, the Metropolitan New York Synod, part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, sold the property for $4.7 million to a developer.

				The sale reflects a broader <a href="https://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/market-insight/features/future-nyc/from-sacred-spaces-living-places-20-former-houses-worship-you-can-call-home/48181" target="_blank">trend</a>: According to NYU’s Furman Center, faith-based organizations own more than 92 million square feet of land across New York’s five boroughs, that’s 2.5 times the size of Central Park. With <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642548/church-attendance-declined-religious-groups.aspx" target="_blank">church attendance declining</a> among nearly all religious groups and housing demand rising, converting churches into residential buildings has quietly become a multimillion-dollar business – and often a necessity for struggling congregations. “It sounds crass, but the church is a business,” said Reverend Amy Kienzle, 44, who served as pastor and mission developer at Park Church Co-Op from 2013 to 2019.

			<p>Shrinking membership, and therefore shrinking revenue, combined with rising operational and maintenance costs for “too many churches” forces hard decisions when buildings no longer serve their mission, said Kienzle. “We’re sitting on assets that could do good in the neighborhood. But it’s all locked up in decrepit buildings.”</p>

<p>Proceeds from church sales are often dedicated for “mission funds” that support more promising ministries elsewhere.</p>
